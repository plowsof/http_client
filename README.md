# http_client

Rough and ready / proof of concept - http client

place .func file in user/sofplus/addons 


to use the zip:

- extract SOF PATINUM.zip to your SoF.exe folder
- Start SoF-http-cl.exe and you're done

This client downloads zip files from here https://github.com/plowsof/sof1maps and extracts them while you connect to a server. You will not notice a thing. No more time wasted

files not in our database will still be downloaded from sof1 server

This client / map files database would not be possible without a select group of people who i'll mention in alphabetical order:
Acadie, A, Chin, d3nd3, O 

- How are new maps added?
all files required for the map must be placed inside a zip, and a pull request must be started @ the sofmaps repo. An admin must aprove before its added to the repo

- Custom server sounds issue
Server admins who add custom sounds on the fly should give us notice so we can grab the files and put them on the http client so people dont get annoyed
