# http_client

Rough and ready / proof of concept - http client

to use the zip:

- extract SOF PATINUM.zip to your SoF.exe folder
- Start SoF-http-cl.bat and you're done
- Create a shortcut for this .bat as it starts your SoF.exe with http downloads available

This client downloads zip files from here https://github.com/plowsof/sof1maps and extracts them while you connect to a server. You will not notice a thing. No more time wasted

files not in our database will still be downloaded from sof1 server

This client / map files database would not be possible without a select group of people who i'll mention in alphabetical order:
Acadie, A, Chin, Ctrl, d3nd3, O 

But most important of all the mappers who spent hours upon hours creating content for us all to enjoy. Thank you!

- How are new maps added?
all files required for the map must be placed inside a zip, and a pull request must be started @ the sofmaps repo. An admin must aprove before its added to the repo

- Custom server sounds issue
Server admins who add custom sounds on the fly should give us notice so we can grab the files and put them on the http client so people dont get annoyed
