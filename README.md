# http_client

Rough and ready / proof of concept - http client

place .func file in user/sofplus/addons 


to use the zip:

extract to your SoF.exe folder

SoF-http-cl.exe will start SoF.exe and the http cmd window 

Single-file downloads are now unsupported e.g. missing textures must be downloaded from server slowly -unless- they are inside the map zip
